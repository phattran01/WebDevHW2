            <li>Is the page appealing or unappealing? List three reasons why.
                <br>
                The page is unappealing because the bright purple colors hurt the eye, the font is unappealing and lacks varriation, and important information reguarding posts are not easily seen.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>If the page looks unappealing, what would you do to improve it?
                <br>
                I would provide a more neutral color palet, present the information provided for each post nicely and change the thumbnails to be thematic rather than the user's profile pictures.
