        Alright, so, my favorite video, or music video, is FINNEAS "Break My Heart Again." One of the things I really like about this little piece 
        is the symbolism on his shirt. In the video, you could see how he struggles to take off his shirt but he doesn't, and if you compare it with 
        the song itself and the lyrics, I feel like the shirt represents his relationship with his girl and how he can't let go of her even though 
        she hurts him a lot.
