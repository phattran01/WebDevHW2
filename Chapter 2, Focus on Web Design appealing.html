            <li>Is the page appealing or unappealing? List three reasons why.
                <br>
                The page is appealing because the organized boxes mixed with pictures are pleasing to the eye, it provides pertinent information (such as dates neatly), and the color palet looks good. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>If the page looks unappealing, what would you do to improve it?
                <br>
                The page does not look unappealing.
